Great — here’s a **one-page executive summary** version of the detailed doc you can share with leadership / non-technical stakeholders:

# Executive Summary – POC on MongoDB Automated Field-Level Encryption (FLE) in Azure VCore

## Purpose

We evaluated whether **MongoDB Automated Field-Level Encryption (FLE)** in **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore** could replace our existing **custom encryption (Spring annotations + listeners)**.

---

## Key Findings

* **Native dependency** – Automated FLE requires the `mongo_crypt_shared_v1` shared library, which Azure does not provide. Applications must package and manage it themselves.
* **Operational overhead** – Adds complexity for Docker/Kubernetes builds and cloud deployments.
* **Minimal benefit** – Migrating would only replace existing custom encryption logic with driver-managed logic, offering no meaningful business advantage.
* **Azure limitations** – Azure Cosmos DB vCore supports only encryption at rest. Client-side FLE libraries are **not natively supported** today.
* **MongoDB limitations** – Automated FLE has restrictions (e.g., no uniqueness checks on encrypted fields, limited operators, no shard key support, reduced observability).

---

## Issues Identified

* Increases DevOps complexity.
* Introduces vendor lock-in.
* Reduces monitoring/diagnostics visibility.
* Requires code refactoring with little return.

---

## Recommendation

* **Continue with current custom encryption** (annotations + listeners).
* **Do not adopt Automated FLE** in Azure VCore at this stage.
* **Monitor** Azure/MongoDB roadmap for future managed support (i.e., native FLE without external libraries).
* Keep our code abstraction flexible so we can re-evaluate when the technology matures.

---

## Conclusion

Automated FLE is **not feasible for production in Azure VCore today**.
Our current **custom encryption remains more portable, maintainable, and easier to operate**.

Would you like me to also create a **side-by-side comparison table** (Custom vs Automated FLE) for quick presentation slides? That would make the trade-offs even clearer at a glance.
