### Notes on Change Stream Listener with Lock Renewal and Failover Mechanism

**Objective**: Implement a change stream listener where two instances compete for a distributed lock. The instance with the lock actively listens for events using the `next()` method on a cursor. The lock is continuously renewed during waiting, ensuring failover to another instance if the first one dies or encounters an exception.

---

#### 1. **Components Overview**
- **Change Stream Listener**: Actively listens to events using the `next()` method.
- **Scheduler**: Periodically renews the lock for the active instance.
- **Distributed Lock**: Ensures only one instance listens to the change stream at a time.

---

#### 2. **Execution Flow**
1. **Initial Lock Acquisition**:
   - Each instance attempts to acquire a distributed lock at startup or upon a scheduler trigger.
   - The instance that successfully acquires the lock begins listening to the change stream.

2. **Listening for Events**:
   - The instance with the lock listens for events using the `cursor.next()` method in a loop.
   - While waiting, the lock is continuously renewed through periodic scheduler triggers.

3. **Lock Renewal**:
   - The active instance renews the lock periodically.
   - Lock renewal ensures continuity of processing and prevents failover during normal operation.

4. **Failover**:
   - **Failure Scenarios**:
     - The instance holding the lock dies unexpectedly (lock expires).
     - An exception occurs in the change stream processing (lock is explicitly released).
   - When the lock expires or is released, other instances compete to acquire the lock.
   - The instance that acquires the lock resumes listening for events.

---

#### 3. **Implementation Details**
1. **Lock Management**:
   - Use a distributed lock with TTL (time-to-live) to handle automatic expiration.
   - Implement a lock renewal mechanism where the active instance refreshes the TTL periodically.

2. **Change Stream Listening**:
   - Wrap the `next()` method in a loop with proper exception handling.
   - Ensure lock renewal occurs even while waiting on the cursor.

3. **Failover Handling**:
   - When a lock expires, any other instance can acquire it.
   - Upon acquiring the lock, the new instance initializes the change stream listener.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Log and handle exceptions from `cursor.next()` gracefully.
   - Explicitly release the lock upon encountering fatal exceptions.

---

#### 4. **Key Considerations**
- **Lock Expiration Timing**:
  - Set the TTL to a value slightly longer than the scheduler's renewal interval to avoid premature expiration.
- **Failover Timing**:
  - Ensure the lock acquisition process by other instances is seamless to minimize downtime.
- **Graceful Shutdown**:
  - Ensure the lock is explicitly released if the application shuts down normally.

---

#### 5. **Tools & Technologies**
- **Distributed Lock**: Redis, ZooKeeper, or database-based locking.
- **Scheduler**: Spring Scheduler, Quartz Scheduler, or a custom timer task.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: To detect lock expirations and failover events.

#### 6. **Sample Pseudocode**
```kotlin
fun startChangeStreamListener() {
    while (true) {
        if (acquireLock(lockId)) {
            try {
                val cursor = initializeChangeStreamCursor()
                while (true) {
                    try {
                        val event = cursor.next() // Block until an event is received
                        processEvent(event)
                    } catch (e: Exception) {
                        log.error("Error processing event: ${e.message}")
                        releaseLock(lockId) // Explicit lock release
                        throw e
                    }
                }
            } finally {
                releaseLock(lockId) // Ensure lock release on shutdown
            }
        } else {
            log.info("Lock not acquired, waiting for the next attempt...")
            Thread.sleep(5000) // Wait before retrying
        }
    }
}

fun acquireLock(lockId: String): Boolean {
    // Try to acquire lock in a distributed system
}

fun releaseLock(lockId: String) {
    // Explicitly release the lock
}

fun renewLock(lockId: String) {
    // Periodically refresh the TTL of the lock
}

// Scheduler for lock renewal
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate {
    if (isLockHeld(lockId)) {
        renewLock(lockId)
    }
}
```

#### 7. **Failover Example**
1. **Scenario**: Instance A is actively listening to the change stream and renewing the lock.
   - **Failure**: Instance A dies (e.g., server crash), and its lock expires automatically.
   - **Failover**: Instance B acquires the lock, initializes the cursor, and resumes processing.

2. **Scenario**: Instance A throws an exception while processing an event.
   - **Recovery**: Instance A releases the lock explicitly, and Instance B acquires it to continue processing.

---

This approach ensures continuous processing of change streams with high availability and failover capability, minimizing downtime and preventing duplicate processing.
