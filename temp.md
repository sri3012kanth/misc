Removing the **country code** field from a phone number object in Cosmos DB, APIs, and downstream systems can have **significant impact** in terms of data quality, business logic, validation, internationalization, and integrations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the **impact and scope**:

---

### üîç 1. **Data Model Impact in Cosmos DB**
- **Field removal**:
  - Documents that previously had `countryCode` will no longer have it.
  - May break queries or indexes that depend on `countryCode`.
- **Partitioning**:
  - If `countryCode` was part of a **composite partition key**, you will face partitioning issues.
- **Data consistency**:
  - Mixed records (some with countryCode, some without) may emerge during migration unless handled properly.

---

### üß© 2. **API Impact**
- **Request/Response schema**:
  - Clients expecting `countryCode` will either break or receive incomplete data.
  - OpenAPI/Swagger specs must be updated to remove `countryCode`.
- **Validation logic**:
  - Validation frameworks (e.g., Bean Validation in Java/Kotlin) may fail if the field is still required.
  - Regex or pattern checks that rely on countryCode-aware formatting will fail or give wrong results.
- **Backward compatibility**:
  - Breaking change for clients expecting `countryCode`. Versioning the API may be necessary.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Downstream Services Impact**
- **Phone normalization logic**:
  - Services that normalize numbers (e.g., into E.164 format) will lack country context.
- **SMS / Voice integrations**:
  - Telecom APIs like Twilio or AWS Pinpoint need country code for routing.
  - Could cause failures or delivery to wrong regions.
- **Analytics and segmentation**:
  - Geographical segmentation by country becomes inaccurate.
  - Metrics by country will degrade unless inferred from other sources.
- **Customer support and verification**:
  - Phone-based authentication may break if the full international format is not provided.
  - OTP, MFA, and fraud detection systems may lose precision.

---

### üìà 4. **User Experience Impact**
- **Form auto-fill and validation**:
  - Users entering a 10-digit number may not be validated properly without country context.
- **International users**:
  - Support for global phone numbers will be compromised.
  - Can reduce usability or block users from outside your default country.

---

### üîÑ 5. **Migration/Transition Considerations**
- **Migration script**:
  - You might need to strip `countryCode` from existing documents or migrate it into `phoneNumber` (e.g., `+19788768888`).
- **Interim dual-field strategy**:
  - Keep both `countryCode` and `phoneNumber` temporarily.
  - Add a new `fullPhoneNumber` field in E.164 and migrate downstream to use that instead.
- **Versioning strategy**:
  - Consider releasing a new API version or schema version.
  - Enable downstream services to migrate gradually.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- **Use E.164 format** (e.g., `+19788768888`) in a single `phoneNumber` field to eliminate the need for separate countryCode.
- **Update validation logic** to assume a default country only if acceptable (e.g., U.S. business assuming +1).
- **Document the change thoroughly**, and ensure all consumers and downstream systems are aligned.
- **Monitor usage and errors** after deployment using logs, metrics, and customer feedback.
