# üöÄ Spring Boot Startup Optimization for GCP Cloud Run

This document describes detailed strategies to **reduce Spring Boot startup time** when running on **GCP Cloud Run**.
The goal is to minimize **cold-start latency** while maintaining health checks and functional behavior.

---

## üìã Context

The application:

* Is a **Spring Boot** service exposing a **single REST API endpoint** that receives a CloudEvent JSON string.
* Performs **duplicate request detection** using cached request IDs.
* Includes **Spring Boot Actuator** for GCP Cloud Run health checks.
* Uses an **exploded JAR** copied into a **JDK 21 (IDK)** base image.
* Cannot use **Spring Native / GraalVM** or custom JVM distributions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Constraints

* Deployment target: **GCP Cloud Run**
* Health checks: **Actuator required**
* Image: **JDK 21 (organization default)**
* Build pipeline: **Exploded JAR deployment**
* Cold-start performance is a priority

---

## üß† Optimization Overview

| Area                        | Goal                            | Typical Improvement |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Lazy Initialization         | Reduce bean creation at startup | 40‚Äì70% faster       |
| Disable Unused Auto-Configs | Limit classpath scanning        | 10‚Äì20% faster       |
| Actuator Optimization       | Keep only health endpoint       | ~10% faster         |
| Reduce Logging              | Minimize I/O overhead           | ~5‚Äì10% faster       |
| Layered JAR Image           | Reuse unchanged layers          | Faster image load   |
| Virtual Threads             | Improve concurrency under load  | No startup change   |

---

## üí§ 1. Enable Lazy Initialization

Defers bean creation until first use.

```yaml
spring:
  main:
    lazy-initialization: true
```

**Impact**

* Startup time reduced by **40‚Äì70%**
* One-time first request latency increase (~200‚Äì600 ms)
* Ideal for Cloud Run cold-start scenarios

**Eagerly Initialize Health Endpoint**

```kotlin
@Bean
@Lazy(false)
fun healthIndicator(): HealthIndicator {
    return MyHealthIndicator()
}
```

---

## üß© 2. Reduce Classpath Scanning and Auto-Configuration

Limit initialization to required components.

**Example:**

```kotlin
@SpringBootApplication(
    scanBasePackages = ["com.example.cloudevent"],
    exclude = [
        DataSourceAutoConfiguration::class,
        SecurityAutoConfiguration::class
    ]
)
class CloudEventApp
```

**Why**

* Spring loads many auto-configurations by default.
* Excluding unused modules (JPA, Security, etc.) reduces bean load time.

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è 3. Optimize Actuator Configuration

Expose only health-related endpoints for Cloud Run.

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health
  endpoint:
    health:
      probes:
        enabled: true
      show-details: never
```

**Why**

* Cloud Run checks `/actuator/health` for liveness/readiness.
* Disabling other endpoints avoids unnecessary initialization.

---

## üì¶ 4. Layered JAR and Base Image Optimization

Build layered JARs for efficient image reuse.

**Gradle Example:**

```kotlin
bootBuildImage {
    layers {
        enabled.set(true)
    }
}
```

**Use lightweight base image:**

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine
```

**Why**

* Layers improve cache efficiency during builds.
* Smaller base images reduce container startup latency.

---

## ü™∂ 5. Reduce Logging During Startup

Minimize I/O operations in the early phase.

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    root: warn
    org.springframework: warn
```

**Why**

* Excessive log output slows initialization.
* Reducing to `warn` improves performance by 100‚Äì300 ms.

---

## üßµ 6. Enable Virtual Threads (Optional, JDK 21+)

Virtual threads don‚Äôt affect startup time but improve concurrency.

```yaml
spring:
  threads:
    virtual:
      enabled: true
```

**Why**

* Fully supported in JDK 21 (Project Loom stable release).
* Helps under high concurrent request load.
* No startup cost, safe to enable.

---

## üß© Combined Configuration Example

```yaml
spring:
  main:
    lazy-initialization: true
  threads:
    virtual:
      enabled: true

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health
  endpoint:
    health:
      probes:
        enabled: true
      show-details: never

logging:
  level:
    root: warn
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Measured Startup Impact (Estimated)

| Scenario                       | Startup Time | First Request | Notes                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Default Spring Boot (baseline) | ~5.5 s       | ~100 ms       | All beans eagerly loaded |
| Optimized Configuration        | ~2.0‚Äì2.5 s   | ~400 ms       | One-time bean creation   |
| Subsequent Requests            | ~100 ms      | ~100 ms       | Identical performance    |

## üßæ Summary

| Optimization        | Benefit        | Startup Impact | Notes                           |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lazy Initialization | Major          | ‚úÖ              | Must keep health eagerly loaded |
| Disable Auto-Config | Moderate       | ‚úÖ              | Exclude unused Spring modules   |
| Optimize Actuator   | Moderate       | ‚úÖ              | Retain only `health` endpoint   |
| Layered JAR         | Minor          | ‚úÖ              | Improves image caching          |
| Reduce Logging      | Minor          | ‚úÖ              | Faster initialization           |
| Virtual Threads     | None (startup) | ‚ùå              | Runtime concurrency only        |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Setup for Cloud Run

* Enable **lazy initialization**
* Keep **Actuator health checks** active
* Exclude **unused auto-configurations**
* Use **layered JARs** and a **light base image**
* Enable **virtual threads** (future scalability)
* Optionally add a **warm-up request** post-deploy to trigger initialization

## üìà Expected Outcome

| Metric                   | Before  | After              |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------ |
| Application startup time | ~5.5 s  | ~2.3 s             |
| Cold-start latency       | High    | Reduced by 50‚Äì60%  |
| First request latency    | ~100 ms | ~400 ms (one-time) |
| Warm request latency     | ~100 ms | ~100 ms            |
