### Notes on Change Stream Listener with Dual Instances and Lock Mechanism

**Objective**: Implement a change stream listener setup with two instances where only one instance processes the pending change streams at a given time, based on a lock mechanism. The other instance skips execution if it cannot acquire the lock.

---

#### 1. **Components Overview**
- **Change Stream Listener**: Listens to database changes and processes them.
- **Scheduler**: Triggers execution at predefined intervals.
- **Lock Mechanism**: Ensures only one instance processes a specific scheduled execution.

---

#### 2. **Execution Flow**
1. **Scheduler Trigger**:
   - Each instance is triggered by a scheduler at the same time.
   - Instances attempt to acquire a lock for the scheduled execution.

2. **Lock Acquisition**:
   - **Lock Identifier**: A unique lock ID is created for each scheduled execution (e.g., based on timestamp or execution ID).
   - **Instance Behavior**:
     - The instance that successfully acquires the lock proceeds with processing the change streams.
     - The other instance skips processing if the lock is unavailable.

3. **Change Stream Processing**:
   - The instance holding the lock:
     - Reads and processes pending change streams.
     - Marks the changes as processed (e.g., updates their status in the database).

4. **Lock Release**:
   - After completing the processing, the lock is released, making it available for future scheduled executions.

---

#### 3. **Implementation Details**
1. **Lock Management**:
   - Use a distributed lock mechanism, such as:
     - **Database Locking**: Store the lock status in a shared database with expiration.
     - **Cache-Based Locking**: Use a distributed cache like Redis with a time-to-live (TTL) setting for lock expiration.
   - Ensure the lock is automatically released after a timeout to prevent deadlocks.

2. **Instance Behavior**:
   - **Primary Instance**:
     - Acquires the lock and processes the change streams.
     - Releases the lock after processing.
   - **Secondary Instance**:
     - Checks for lock availability.
     - Skips execution if the lock is held by the primary instance.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry logic for lock acquisition with backoff for transient issues.
   - Log instances where processing is skipped due to lock unavailability.
   - Monitor and alert if a lock remains unreleased beyond the expected time.

---

#### 4. **Key Considerations**
- **Lock Granularity**: Ensure the lock is unique for each scheduled execution to avoid conflicts.
- **Failover**:
  - If the primary instance fails mid-processing, the lock's TTL ensures that the secondary instance can retry after expiration.
- **Scalability**:
  - The solution should handle increased load by distributing change streams across multiple locks and processing them concurrently.

---

#### 5. **Tools & Technologies**
- **Lock Mechanism**: Redis, ZooKeeper, or a database with row-level locking.
- **Scheduler**: Quartz Scheduler, Spring Scheduler, or Kubernetes CronJobs.
- **Monitoring**: Logs and metrics to track lock acquisition, processing duration, and skipped executions.

---

#### 6. **Sample Pseudocode**
```kotlin
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate {
    val lockId = "change-stream-lock-${executionId}"
    if (acquireLock(lockId)) {
        try {
            processChangeStreams()
        } finally {
            releaseLock(lockId)
        }
    } else {
        log.info("Lock not acquired, skipping execution")
    }
}

fun acquireLock(lockId: String): Boolean {
    // Try to acquire the lock (e.g., insert/update in DB or set key in Redis)
}

fun releaseLock(lockId: String) {
    // Release the lock (e.g., delete key or update DB status)
}
```

This design ensures reliable processing of change streams with no overlap, while maintaining fault tolerance and scalability.
